Attendance Buddy – Because I’m a Lazy Engineer
After a long, boring lecture, the last thing I want is to hang around while the class rep collects roll numbers, types them up, and adds all the course details for the professor. So, I built Attendance Buddy — my personal one-stop tool to select the date, course name, course code, and respective professor, then instantly generate a ready-to-send attendance list.

No databases, no logins — just a for-me-only automation that turns an annoying daily chore into a quick tap. A tiny side project that makes my engineering life easier, all thanks to a mix of laziness and code.
